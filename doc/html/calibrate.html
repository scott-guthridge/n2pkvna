<h2 id="cal_types">Calibration Model</h2>
<img src="cal-model.svg">

<p>The VNA must be calibrated using known reference standards to correct
for errors in the VNA, directional bridges, connectors, cables, test
fixture and other components.  Most of these errors can be modeled
as an <q>error box</q> sitting between a perfect VNA and the device
under test (DUT).  Later, when making measurements of a device under
test, we mathematically remove (de-embed) the error box to correct the
measurements.

<p>The <b>a1</b> and <b>a2</b> inputs into the error box are incident
signals from the VNA to the DUT.  Some VNA's measure these.  When not
measured, we assume that during the forward measurement, a1=1 and a2=0,
and during the reverse measurement, a1=0 and a2=1.  The reflected signals
from the DUT to the VNA are the outputs, <b>b1</b> and <b>b2</b>, which
the VNA measures.

<p>The <b>x1</b>, <b>y1</b>, <b>x2</b> and <b>y2</b> arrows define the
<q>reference plane</q> that delineates the VNA from the DUT.

<p>The error terms are simply the S-parameters of the error box.
Since the error box is a 4-port device, it has 16 terms.  Depending on
the calibration type, however, we may or may not include all sixteen
error terms.

<p>It's convenient to write the error terms as a 2x2 matrix of matrices:

<p>Where the four sub-matrices, Ed, Er, Et and Em represent, directivity
error, reflection tracking error, transmission tracking error and port
match error, respectively.

<p>The goal of calibration is to solve for the error terms using
measurements of known standards.  While the scattering parameter form of
the error box is easy to understand, it's not easy to solve the error
parameters in this form.  It's much easier to solve for them in the
scattering transfer (T) or inverse scattering transfer (U) form where the
problem becomes a linear system of equations.  If E terms are desired,
we can then convert the resulting T or U terms to E.  The conversion
from T to E is the same as for converting t-parameters to s-parameters
except that the elements of the 2x2 T matrix are matrices.


<h2 id="cal_types">Calibration Types</h2>

<p>The software supports several types of error terms, capable of
correcting different errors.  In general, calibration types with more
error terms correct for more errors, but this comes at a cost of requiring
more calibration standards.  Also, while it may seem better to always use
calibrations that correct for more errors, correcting for errors you
don't actually have in your test setup may in fact add correlated noise
to your measurements.  Therefore, it's important to consider which errors
are likely significant in a given situation and choose a calibration
type that matches.

<p>For all supported calibration types, the software solves for the error
terms using either scattering transfer (T) or inverse scattering transfer
(U) parameters which turn the problem into a linear system of equations.
This provides wide flexibility in the choice of standards used, and
it makes it always possible to use more than the minimum required
number of standards in a calibration.  If the resulting linear system
is over-determined, the software finds a least-squares solution using
Q-R decomposition.

<p>The E12 type is a generalization of the classic 12-term error
correction model historically calibrated using SOLT or OSLT.  Under the
covers, it's solved using U parameters which are then converted to
E parameters.

<p>The rest of this section goes through each calibration type,
shows which errors are corrected, and gives the calibration standard
requirements.

<h3 id="cal_1x1">Dimensions 1x1</h3>
<p><img src="E8_1x1.svg">		<!-- ALL: 3 error terms -->

<p>In reflection only setups, the choice of calibration type doesn't
matter -- all types correct for the same three errors: directivity,
reflection tracking, and source match.  These are labeled Ed11, Er11 and
Em11, respectively, in the diagram.  Et11 is a free variable which we
set to 1.

<p>The choice of E, T or U error terms changes only the way the error
terms are stored in the VNA calibration file.  Mathematically, all are
equivalent.

<p>This calibration requires a minimum of three distinct reflect
standards.  Typical choices are short, open, and match.

<hr>
<h3 id="cal_2x1">Dimensions 2x1</h3>
<h4 id="cal_2x1_U8">Type U8</h4>
<p><img src="E8_2x1.svg">		<!-- U8: 6 error terms, 1 free -->

<p>The simplest calibration in the 2x1 setup has 6 error terms, one
of which is a free variable (typically Et11 is set to 1), giving it
effectively 5 terms.  The software solves for the error terms using
inverse scattering transfer (U) parameters where they form a linear
system.  The calibration type is called U8, the 8 being the number of
error terms this type produces in the 2x2 configuration.

<p>Typical choice of standards are short, open, match, and through.
It's possible, however, to perform this calibration using only three
standards, e.g. through, reflect and delay.

<h4 id="cal_2x1_UE10">Types UE10, E12</h4>
<p><img src="E10_2x1.svg">		<!-- UE10, E12: 7-1, 6 -->

<p>We can improve on the U8 calibration for free by adding the off
diagonal directivity leakage terms to the model: in this case the Ed21
term, bringing the effective number of errors terms to 6.  Whenever we're
measuring a reflect standard on port 1, we can opportunistically measure
the leakage term into the second detector.  The N2PK VNA application
solves this system using a hybrid of scattering (E) and inverse scattering
transfer (U) parameters.  The opportunistically measured leakage terms
are first subtracted out, then the system is solved using U parameters
where it becomes a linear system.

<p>The E12 calibration type (the well known 12-error term model in
2x2) is equivalent to UE10 in this setup, providing six error terms.
When E12 is used, the software solves the system using U parameters as
above then converts the U parameters to scattering E parameters before
saving the calibration.  Thus in the 2x1 setup, UE10 and E12 are exactly
the same except for the format in which they save the error terms.

<p>Like in U8, typical choice of standards are short, open, match,
and through.  Here also, it's possible to perform the calibration using
only three standards, e.g. through, reflect and delay.

<h4 id="cal_2x1_U16">Type U16</h4>
<p><img src="E16_2x1.svg">		<!-- U16: 12-1 -->

<p>When using a test fixture with significant crosstalk between the
probes, a stronger model that corrects for the additional errors
is needed.  The U16 calibration type provides 12 error terms, one
of which is a free variable, giving it effectively 11 error terms.
The software solves this calibration using inverse scattering
transfer (U) terms, where it's a linear system.

<p>In 2x1 setups, at least six standards are required for calibration!
For example, a possible choice is: short-open, short-match, open-match,
open-short, match-short and through.  Why six?  We have to solve for
11 unknowns, and each standard gives us at most two measurements.
So at minimum, we need at least 5 two-port standards and 1 single-port
standard to reach 11.

<hr>
<h3 id="cal_1x2">Dimensions 1x2</h3>

<p>When the calibration has more columns than rows, we cannot use U
parameters.  Instead, we use T parameters.  The T8, TE10 and T16 types
are duals of U8, UE10 and U16, respectively, correcting for the same
errors as their counterparts.

<h4 id="cal_1x2_T8">Type T8</h4>
<p><img src="E8_1x2.svg">		<!-- T8: 6-1 -->

<p>In the 2x1 setup, T8 calibration provides six error terms of which
one is a free variable, leaving effectively five terms.

<p>Typical choice of standards are short, open, match, and through.
It's possible, however, to perform this calibration using only three
standards, e.g. through, reflect and delay.

<h4 id="cal_1x2_TE10">Type TE10</h4>
<p><img src="E10_1x2.svg">		<!-- TE10: 7-1 -->

<p>The TE10 calibration type adds the off-diagonal directivity leakage
term Ed12, bringing the effective number of error terms to six.

<p>Calibration standard requirements are the same as for U8, UE10 and T8.
Typical choice of standards are short, open, match, and through.  As
the other cases, it's possible to perform the calibration using only
three standards, e.g. through, reflect and delay.

<h4 id="cal_1x2_T16">Type T16</h4>
<p><img src="E16_1x2.svg">		<!-- T16: 12-1 -->

<p>The T16 calibration type adds additional leakage terms that correct
for crosstalk between the probes in the test fixture.

<p>As in U16, in 1x2 dimension setups, at least six calibration standards
are required.  A possible choice is: short-open, short-match, open-match,
open-short, match-short and through.

<hr>
<h3 id="cal_2x2">Dimensions 2x2</h3>

With a 2x2 setup, each calibration type produces the number of error terms
in its name.  Though we have more error terms here than in the previous
sections, perhaps surprisingly, we can often perform the calibrations with
fewer standards because each calibration produces four measurements (s11,
s12, s21, and s22) instead of only one or two in the previous sections.
Another difference is that the E12 calibration type becomes two completely
independent 2x1 systems instead of a 2x2.  This is useful in that it
corrects for errors introduced by the forward/reverse switch.

<h4 id="cal_2x2_T8">Types: T8, U8</h3>
<p><img src="E8_2x2.svg">		<!-- T8, U8: 8-1 -->

<p>In the 2x2 setup, T8 and its dual U8 produce 8 error terms, one of which
is a free variable, giving effectively 7 error terms.

<p>The 2x2 T8 and U8 calibrations require only three standards, e.g.
short-open, short-match, and through.  At least one of the standards
must have a through component, e.g. through or delay.

<h4 id="cal_2x2_TE10">Types: TE10, UE10</h3>
<p><img src="E10_2x2.svg">		<!-- TE10, UE10: 10-1 -->

<p>The TE10 and UE10 calibration types add the off-diagonal directivity
leakage terms Ed12 and Ed21, bringing the effective number of error terms
up to 9.  Again, only three calibration standards are needed. There is
an additional requirement, however, that at least one standard must be
a double reflect, e.g. has no through component.

<h4 id="cal_2x2_E12">Type: E12</h3>
<p><img src="E12_2x2f.svg">		<!-- E12: 6+6 -->

<p>The E12 calibration type is a generalization of the well-known 12-term
error correction model, historically calibrated using SOLT or OSLT standards.

<p>In the forward direction, E12 produces six error terms exactly as in
the 2x1 UE10/E12 calibrations above.

<p><img src="E12_2x2r.svg">

<p>And in the reverse direction, it produces another set of six error
terms, again as in the 2x1 UE10/E12 case, except with the ports rotated.
Together, these form the expected 12 error terms

<p>The advantage of using two independent 2x1 systems over a single
2x2 system is that it corrects for errors in the forward/reverse switch
without having to know the incident signal (reference or "a" measurements)
on the DUT, because when the switch is changed, a completely separate
set of error terms is used.  This calibration can even correct for
errors in a switch that lies between the directional couplers and DUT.

<p>These parameters are solved using a hybrid of scattering (E) and
inverse scattering transfer (U) parameters as in the UE10 calibration.  As
with all the other the methods described here, this turns the calibration
problem into a linear system of equations, providing broad flexibility
in the choice of standards used.  If more than the required number of
standards is used, the error terms are solved in a least-squares manner.

<p>This calibration requires a minimum of four calibration standards.
A typical choice is: short-open, match-open, match-short, through.
At least one standard must have a through component, e.g. through or
delay, and at least one standard must have no through component, e.g.
short-open.

<h4 id="cal_2x2_T16">Type: T16, U16</h3>
<p><img src="E16_2x2.svg">		<!-- T16, U16: 16-1 -->

<p>The T16 and U16 calibration types produce 16 error terms, one of which
is a free variable, giving effectively 15 error terms.  These calibrations
correct for all leakages including crosstalk between the VNA probes in
the test fixture.  Note, however, that they don't correct for errors in
the forward/reverse switch unless the incident signals on the DUT ('a'
measurements) are known.  As a result, it's important to use care in the
design of the RF switch.

<p>At least five two-port standards are required for this calibration.
A typical choice is: short-open, short-match, open-match, open-short
and through.

<h2 id="cal_perform">Performing the Calibration</h2>

<img src="calibrate-screen.png"/>

<p>Under the <text class="button">Calibrate</text> tab, select the VNA
setup that should be used with this configuration, the error term type,
and a short name for the calibration.  In the Description box, you can
optionally write a more detailed description of the setup and conditions
under which the calibration is being made.

<p>The Sweep settings are filled in automatically from the setup.
If desired, you can narrow but not widen the frequency range.  Select
the number of frequency steps and whether the VNA should use linear
or logarithmic spacing.  Note that because of the way the VNA does
frequency interpolation, it's generally better to have a smaller number
of accurately measured calibration points than a much larger number of
noisy ones.

<p>The software automatically fills in the Standards table with a viable
sequence of calibration standards.  You can use the suggested standards
or alternately use a set of your choice.  You can use any arbitrary known
single or dual port device as a standard by copying the network parameter
data file into the VNA's configuration directory, "$HOME/.n2pkvna/*/"
before starting the program.  The filename must end in ".npd", ".ts",
".s1p" or ".s2p".

<p>When ready, press the <text class="button">Run Calibration</text>
button and follow the prompts.
