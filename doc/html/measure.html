<h2 id="m_scan">Performing a Scan</h2>

<img src="measure-screen.png"/>

<p>The first step in measuring a device is to select a calibration and
set up the hardware as it was when the calibration was made.

<p>Next, set the frequency range, number of points and linear vs.
logarithmic frequency spacing.  You can narrow but not widen the frequency
range.  If the new frequency points don't align with those used during
calibration, the application uses rational fraction interpolation to
interpolate the error terms.  If you don't make any changes, the Sweep
parameters default to those used for the calibration.

<p>Note that: automatic attenuation is not yet supported.

<p>If you know that the device under test is fully symmetrical,
i.e. S11=S22 and S12=S21, check <text class="button">Symmetrical
DUT</text>.

<p>Connect the VNA to the device and when ready, press <text
class="button">Start Scan</text>.  Follow any prompts.

<h2 id="m_display">Displaying the Result</h2>
<p>Use the Parameters control to display the scan result in the desired
format.  Supported network parameter types are S, T, U, Z, Y, H, G, A
and B.  Also supported are input impedances looking into each DUT port
(Zin), impedances written as equivalent R-C or R-L series or parallel
circuits, return loss, insertion loss and VSWR.  Not all formats are
applicable to all scans.

<p>Use the Coordinates box to switch beteen real-imaginary,
magnitude-angle and dB-angle.

<i>Note that polar and Smith charts aren't yet supported.</i>.

<p>Use the plot controls to set ranges and axis labels.  Press <text
class="button">Replot</text> for range changes to take effect.

<h2 id="m_save">Saving to a File</h2>
<p>The <text class="button">Save As</text> button brings up a file dialog
to save the currently displayed parameters to a file.  The filename
extension determines the file format.  Valid extensions are .s1p and
.s2p for Touchstone 1 format, .ts for Touchstone 2 format, or .npd for
Network Parameter Data format.  If the filename doesn't end with one of
these extensions, .npd format is used.

<p>You can load previously saved parameters using the <text
class="button">Open</text> button.  This is useful for displaying the
parameters in different formats and for converting from one format
to another.  Behavior is currently undefined if the loaded file has
more than two ports.
