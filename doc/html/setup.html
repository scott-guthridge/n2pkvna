<h2 id="add_users">Add Users to the n2pkvna Group</h2>
<p>Users must be members of the <b>n2pkvna</b> group in order to access
the N2PK VNA device.  Use the usermod command to add users to the group.
Example: to add users rufferto and krypto, use:

<code><pre>
    sudo usermod -aG n2pkvna rufferto
    sudo usermod -aG n2pkvna krypto
</pre></code>

<p>The new permission goes into effect on the user's next login.

<h2 id="cal_frequency">Calibrate the Reference Frequency</h2>

<p>You can correct for errors in the VNA's reference oscillator
by connecting the VNA to a trusted frequency counter and using the
<text class="button">Calibrate Frequency</text> button under the VNA
Application's Setup tab.  During the calibration, the VNA generates a
test frequency (10 MHz by default) and prompts the user to type in the
actual measured frequency.  The software then corrects the frequency
coefficient and saves the updated value to the VNA's configuration file.

<p>Initially, the software assumes the VNA uses the Connor Winfield
reference oscillator with a frequency of 156.25 MHz.  If you know that
the VNA uses a different reference frequency and don't have a trusted
frequency counter, you can still use the frequency calibration procedure
to correct the frequency coefficient.  For example, if the VNA uses
the Valpey oscillator at 148.344 MHz, run the frequency calibration,
accept the default of 10 MHz then enter a measured value of 9.494016 MHz.
You can also edit the VNA configuration file ($HOME/.n2pkvna/*/config)
directly using a text editor and update the referenceFrequency attribute,
given in Hz.  The file is stored in YAML format.

<h2 id="setup_identify">Identify the Hardware Configuration</h2>

<p>Before the VNA software can create calibrations or perform measurements
of a DUT, it has to know the hardware setup in which it's operating.
The next section will detail how to create a "setup" in the software.
Before doing that, let's look at a few important concepts.

<p><u>Setup Dimensions:</u> The setup dimensions (and equivalently the
calibration dimensions) are simply the dimensions of the S-parameter
matrix the VNA can measure <em>without</em> manual swaps of the DUT ports
at the reference plane.  For example, if the VNA measures reflection on
one port only (S11), then the dimensions are simply 1x1.  If the VNA
measures reflection on port 1 (S11) and transmission on port 2 (S21),
then it has dimensions 2x1.  It can generate signal on both ports but can
only measure the signal received on port 1 (S11 and S12), then it has
dimensions 1x2.  Finally, if it measures all four S parameters without
manual port swaps, then the dimension is 2x2.  Another way of looking
at the dimensions is that the number of rows is the number of ports on
which the VNA measures received signals, and the number of columns is
the number of ports on which VNA transmits signal.

<p><u>Switches</u>: The N2PK VNA has two digital switch outputs that
can be used to operate relays or solid-state RF switches to change what
the VNA detectors measure and how it drives signal to the DUT.  Not all
setups use the switch outputs.  If they do, however, then the software
needs to know how to drive them.

<p><u>Manual Steps</u>: In addition to automatic switch outputs, the
VNA software can optionally ask the user to operate manual switches or
change cables, etc.  In this context, manual steps do not include
DUT port swaps at the reference plane.

<p><u>Detector Measurements</u>: Within each manual step and switch
combination, there are sixteen possible measurements each detector can
make.  These correspond to the elements of the following four matrices:

<p>The <b>a</b> matrix describes the incident signals from the VNA
onto the DUT.  High end VNA's typically have dedicated detectors for
the <b>a</b> measurements; the N2PK VNA, doesn't have them.  The <a
href="#rb_ref_2x2">last hardware setup example</a> below shows how
<b>a</b> parameters can be measured for the N2PK VNA, but in most
configurations here, the <b>a</b> matrix is not measured and is simply
assumed to be the identity matrix.

<p>The <b>b</b> matrix describes the reflected signals from the DUT
back to the VNA.  The numbering of the elements is as follows: b11
is the reflected signal received on VNA probe 1 during the forward
measurement; b21 is through signal received on VNA probe 2 during
the forward measurement; b12 is through signal received on VNA probe 1
during the reverse measurement, and finally, b22 is the reflected signal
received on VNA probe 2 during the reverse measurement.  The elements
of the other matrices follow the same numbering pattern.

<p>In some hardware configurations, one or both of the directional
couplers is replaced with an RF-IV detector.  The first column of the
<b>i</b> matrix describes the currents flowing toward the DUT in each
VNA probe during the forward measurement; the
second column describes the corresponding currents flowing into the DUT
during the reverse measurement.  The <b>v</b> matrix similarly describes
the voltages on each DUT port.

<p>Following are several examples of hardware setups, their dimensions
and the values each detector measures.

the impedance into a DUT port more accurately than the directional
coupler when the impedance is far away from the reference impedance of
50 ohms.  Detector 1 measures voltage or current, depending on the switch
value; detector 2 measures the through signal received from probe 2
independent of the switch setting.  Notice that b21 is measured twice;
the VNA software averages the two b21 measurements.

<p>This configuration is like the S-Parameter Test Set above except that
it measures transmitted signal into the DUT in addition to reflected
signal received from the DUT.  In all prior examples, we assumed that
the incident signal on probes 1 and 2 were 1.0 and 0.0, respectively,
in the forward measurement direction, and 0.0 and 1.0, respectively,
in the reverse measurement direction.  With knowledge of the incident
signal, the VNA can correct for variations in the VNA output amplitude
level and errors introduced by the forward/reverse switch, removing
the necessity to use a calibration method that corrects for the
forward/reverse switch.  It's important, however, to use high quality
switches for the incident/reflected switch because none of the available
calibration methods can correct for errors introduced in these switches.
Without care, errors introduced in the incident/reflected switches
may potentially outweigh any benefits of measuring the incident signal.

<h2 id="setup_create">Creating the Setup</h2>
<img src="setup-menu.png"/>

<p>Five of the buttons on the Setup tab:
<text class="button">Configure Reflection Bridge</text>,
<text class="button">Configure S Parameter Test Set</text>,
<text class="button">Configure RF-IV</text>,
<text class="button">Create Custom</text>,
and <text class="button">Edit</text>,
open the same switch and detector edit screen that describes the switch
settings and detector measurements (shown below).  The difference between
these buttons is only in how the switch and detector screen is initially
filled in.

<p>The <text class="button">Configure Reflection Bridge</text>
button opens the switch and detector edit screen with typical default
values for the <a href="#rb_2x1">Reflection Bridge 2x1</a> setup.
For the <a href="#rb_1x1">Reflection Bridge 1x1</a>, use this option
and change the dimensions to 1x1.  For the single detector variants: <a
href="#rb_s_1x2">Single Detector 1x2</a> and <a href="#rb_s_2x1">Single
Detector 2x1</a>, use this option, fix the dimensions, select 1 detector,
either check the <text class="button">use switch</text> button or set
two manual steps, and fill in the table entries.  You if you have more
than one of these configurations, give each a different name, e.g. RB_1x1
and RB_2x1.

<p>The <text class="button">Configure S Parameter Test Set</text>
button opens the edit screen with typical defaults for the <a
href="#s_2x2">S-Parameter Test Set</a>.

<p>The <text class="button">Configure RF-IV</text> opens the edit screen
with typical defaults for the <a href="rfiv_2x1">RF-IV</a> detector.

<p>The <text class="button">Create Custom</text> opens the edit screen
with nothing already filled in.  Use the setup examples shown in <a
href="#setup_identify">Identify the Hardware Configuration</a> section
above for guidance on creating custom configurations.

<p>Use the <text class="button">Edit</text> button to modify existing setups.

<h3>Switch and Detector Edit Screen</h3>
<img src="setup-edit-dialog.png"/>

<p>The first field on the edit screen is a short name for the VNA setup.
The built-in setups supply a suggested name -- you can change it if
desired.  If you're edited an existing setup and change the name, this
doesn't rename the old setup but rather saves the modified setup under
the new name.  Think of it as "save as" instead of "save".
<!-- TODO: revisit -->
<i>There currently isn't a delete setup -- it's easy to add, just
isn't there yet.  You can delete setups manually by editing the VNA
configuration file.</i>

<p>The <text class="button">Hide</text> check box causes the Setup to be
hidden from new Calibrations.  You can later edit and unhide.  This can
be useful for temporarily disabling experimental setups and decluttering
the calibration screen.

<p>The dimensions menu describes what subset of the S parameters
the VNA measures <em>without</em> physically swapping DUT ports.
Rows describes how many VNA ports measure signal from the DUT; columns
describes how many VNA ports drive signal into the DUT.

<p>The Frequency Range fields describe the frequency range of the VNA
setup.  If you're using a transverter, fill in the shifted frequency
range and also enter local oscillator frequency of the transverter into
the fOsc field; if not using a transverter, leave fOsc blank.
<!-- TODO: revisit -->
<i>Note: transverter support in the software is currently untested.
Contact the author if you would like to help or be a tester for this
feature.</i>

<p>With the <text class="button">Number of Manual Steps</text> spin
button, it's possible to add manual steps in addition to automatic
switch outputs.  For example, suppose that the VNA uses a manual switch
to select between forward and reverse measurements instead of using
the electronic switch output.  Then two manual steps can be selected,
one for forward and one for the reverse.  Setting the number of manual
steps to 1 will cause the VNA software to always prompt the user before
making measurements.  Normally, however, this field is set to zero.
In many VNA configurations, it's necessary to manually swap DUT ports at
the reference plane in order to measure the full S parameters of the DUT.
Don't include those swaps here.  This setting applies only to manual
steps on the VNA side of the reference plane.

<p>Use the Number of Detectors <text class="button">1</text> and
<text class="button">2</text> radio buttons to select whether the
current setup uses one or two detectors.  Similarly, check the <text
class="button">use switch</text>, <text class="button">use RFIV</text>
and <text class="button">use references</text> boxes as needed in the
setup.  These buttons simply add and remove choices in the table below
to eliminate inapplicable choices.

<p>Fill in the measurements table with the manual steps, switch settings
and what each detector measures.  The table automatically removes unneeded
columns based on the check buttons above.

<p>When the table is filled correctly, press <text class="button">Save</text>
to save the setup.

<!-- TODO: revisit -->
<p><i>Note: When using manual steps, the Edit Custom Text button is
meant to let you enter a custom message that will be shown to the user
when measuring.  This button is not yet implemented.</i>
