<h2 id="gen_quadrature">Generating Two Signals in Quadrature</h2>

<p>Under the Generate tab, we can use the N2PK VNA as a signal generator.
Click <text class="button">Master Enable</text> to enable the output.  

<p>The fields on the main screen are not editable directly.  Click the
<text class="button">Edit</text> button to open an edit dialog to modify
the values.  Only the fields into which you enter values are changed.

<p>For example, here we change the phase to 90 degress and click <text
class="button">Apply</text> to put the outputs into quadrature.

<p>Back on the main screen, we can see that frequencies are unchanged
but phase is now 90&#176;.

<p>Oscilloscope channel 1 is RF Out and channel 2 is LO-DDS-1 out.
We can see that LO-DDS-1 leads in phase by 90&#176;.

<p>Two details: First, notice that the amplitude on RF out is about
twice that of LO-DDS-1.  Second, it's not shown here, but if we use
the LO-DDS-2 output instead of LO-DDS-1, we'll see that the two LO-DDS
outputs are 180&#176; out of phase with respect to LO-DDS-1.  Both are
explained if you look at the N2PK VNA schematic.  The DDS chips have
complementary outputs.  For the LO-DDS, each is routed to a separate
external output; for the RF-DDS, however, the two outputs are combined
through a transformer.

<h2 id="gen_xy">Generating Multiple Frequencies</h2>

<p>To generate two different frequencies, press <text
class="button">Edit</text>, and uncheck <text class="button">Lock to
RF</text> then set RF Frequency and LO Frequency.

<p>When we change the frequencies or phase, the N2PK VNA synchronizes
the DDS's so that they start up with a consistent phase relationship.
Even when we're generating two different frequencies, the phase
relationship can be meaningful, especially if the two frequencies are
related by small integer ratios.
In this example, we generate 3 MHz on RF out and 4 MHz on LO-DDS-1.
If we start out with a 90 degree phase difference and display on the
oscilloscope in X-Y mode, we get this:

<p>But if we change the phase to 0, we get a pretzel:
