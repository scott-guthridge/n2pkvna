N2PKVNA: Library and Utilities for the N2PK Vector Network Analyzer
Copyright Â© 2021-2022 D Scott Guthridge <scott-guthridge@rompromity.net>

== Introduction ==

The programs in this package provide an open-source software solution
for controlling the open hardware N2PK Vector Network Analyzer.  See
https://www.makarov.ca/vna.htm


== Current Limitations ==

Only the v4 and v5 USB models are supported.  Parallel port support can
be added if there's sufficient interest.  Supported models are:

    USB Vendor: 0547
    USB Product: 1004, 1005, 1008, 1009, 100a, 100b, 100c and 100d

While the command line program supports multiple VNA devices attached
to the same computer, the GUI currently can handle only one.  This would
be pretty easy to fix -- volunteer to help test it.


== Build, Test & Install ==

Prerequisites:
  - C compiler such as gcc or clang that can compile the C99 standard
  - make
  - libusb development package

	Fedora, RedHat, Centos, SuSE
	    yum install gcc make libusbx-devel

        Debian, Ubuntu
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install gcc make libusb-1.0-0-dev

  - libvna
	https://github.com/scott-guthridge/libvna
	See libvna README for installation instructions.


If you're starting with a distribution tarball, e.g.
n2pkvna-x.y.z.tar.gz, unpack the tar file:

    tar xzf n2pkvna-x.y.z.tar.gz
    cd n2pkvna-x.y.z

There should be a "configure" script in the top-level directory.

Otherwise, or if you've either cloned or downloaded the sources from git,
you'll need to install autotools and bootstrap them:

    Fedora, RedHat, Centos, SuSE
	sudo yum install autoconf automake libtool

    Debian, Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool

    At the top level of the source tree, run:
	./bootstrap


You can now build RPM or Debian packages (as appropriate for your OS
distribution) and install from those, or you can build and install into
/usr/local/ directly from the sources.  The package route is preferable
because you can update and remove the programs using the standard package
tools that come with your distribution, and you avoid some possible
library path programs described below.

Option 1: Build RPM Packages and Install from RPM

    sudo yum install rpm-build
    ./configure
    make rpm
    sudo rpm -U rpm/*/*.rpm

Option 2: Build Debian packages and install using apt

    sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts
    ./configure
    make deb
    ( cd deb && sudo apt install ./*.deb )

Option 3: Build and install into /usr/local/* from source

    Install run-time dependencies:

	Fedora, RedHat, Centos, SuSE
	    yum install fxload
	    yum install perl-Browser-Open perl-Cairo perl-Carp perl-Clone \
			perl-File-Temp perl-Glib perl-Gtk3 perl-open \
			perl-Thread-Queue perl-threads perl-YAML-LibYAML

        Debian, Ubuntu
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install fxload
	    sudo apt-get install libbrowser-open-perl libcairo-perl \
				 libclone-perl libfile-temp-perl libglib-perl \
				 libgtk3-perl libyaml-libyaml-perl

    ./configure
    make
    sudo sh -c 'umask 022 && make install'
    sudo ldconfig
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

    By default, the files are installed in /usr/local/
	/usr/local/include/*.h
	/usr/local/lib/libn2pkvna.so.*
	/usr/local/share/doc/n2pkvna/*
	/usr/local/share/man/man3/*.3

    Some Linux distros (such as Fedora 31) don't include /usr/local/lib
    in the default dyanamic library search path.  If you get an error like
    the following when trying to run a program you linked against n2pkvna:

	error while loading shared libraries: n2pkvna.so.0: cannot open
	shared object file: No such file or directory

    Add /usr/local/lib to the default library search path:

	sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	sudo chmod 644 /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	sudo ldconfig


== Add Users to the n2pkvna Group ==

    sudo usermod -aG n2pkvna username1
    sudo usermod -aG n2pkvna username2
    ...

    This gives the named users access to the n2pkvna USB device.


== Documentation ==

Man Pages

    man 1 n2pkvna	# describes the command line interface
    man 3 n2pkvna	# describes the n2pkvna library

    You can build PDF verions (requires the pdfroff package) with:
	make pdfman

    the .pdf files appear in src/*/*.pdf

HTML Documents

    doc/index.html, or select Help / Manual from the GUI


The code is still undergoing development.  While the version remains at
0.x.x, there may be a few compatiblity breaks.

Please make suggestions for how this software could be improved.  If
