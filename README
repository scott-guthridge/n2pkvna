N2PKVNA: Library and Utilities for the N2PK Vector Network Analyzer
Copyright Â© 2021 D Scott Guthridge <scott-guthridge@rompromity.net>

Prerequisites:
    - You'll need a C99 level C compiler such as gcc or clang.

    - libusb_1.0 and libyaml

	Fedora, RedHat, Centos
	    sudo yum install libusbx-devel libyaml-devel

	Debian, Ubuntu
	    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libyaml-dev

	Libyaml can also be built from source:
	    https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML

    - libvna
	Build from source:
	    https://github.com/scott-guthridge/libvna


Build, Test and Install:
    ./bootstrap		# If building from git; skip if building from tarball.
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

    The files are installed in /usr/local/ 
	/usr/local/include/*.h
	/usr/local/lib/libn2pkvna.so.*
	/usr/local/share/doc/n2pkvna/*
	/usr/local/share/man/man3/*.3

    The example programs and README-EXAMPLES files are copied into
    /usr/local/share/doc/n2pkvna.  The README-EXAMPLES is worded
    for someone building the example programs by hand after the library
    has been installed on the system.  After running a make all here,
    though the examples will already be built in the src/ directory.


Fixing library path problems:
    Some Linux distros (such as Fedora 31) don't include /usr/local/lib
    in the default dyanamic library search path.  If you get an error like
    the following when trying to run a program you linked against n2pkvna:

	error while loading shared libraries: n2pkvna.so.0: cannot open
	shared object file: No such file or directory

    Add /usr/local/lib to the default library search path:

    	sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	sudo chmod 644 /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
	sudo ldconfig


To build PDF versions of the man pages (requries pdfroff):
    make pdfman

    The .pdf files appear in src/*/


To build RPM files:
    make srcrpm
    make rpm

    The source RPM appears in rpm/n2pkvna-*.src.rpm.  Binary RPMs appear
    in an architecture-specific subdirectory, e.g. rpm/x86-64/.

    When installing from RPM, the installed files go into the normal
    system directories such as /usr/include, /usr/lib64, /usr/share/doc,
    and /usr/share/man instead of /usr/local/


The code is still undergoing some final development.  While the version
remains at 0.0.x, there may be a few compatiblity breaks.

Please make suggestions for how this software could be improved.  And if
you'd like to help, please contact scott-guthridge@rompromity.net.
