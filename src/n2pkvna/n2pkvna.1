.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBn2pkvna\fP [\fB-a\fP \fIattenuation\fP] [\fB-N\fP \fIname\fP] [\fB-U\fP \fIunit\fP] [\fIcommand opts...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBn2pkvna\fP command controls N2PK vector network analyzers (VNAs).
The \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2 is an open hardware electronic test and measurement
device used to measure the scattering parameters of an unknown device
under test (DUT).
The \fBn2pkvna\fP command provides several subcommands.  If a subcommand
is given on the argument list, it runs just the single subcommand;
otherwise, it enters a command line interpreter that takes any number
of subcommands.

.sp 1
Calibrate the vector network analyzer using known calibration standards.
The \fIdescription\fP option is a short textual description of the conditions
of the calibration such as the probe cable length and set up that is
saved with the calibration.
The \fIfMin\fP and \fPfMax\fP parameters are the minimum and maximum
frequencies in MHz used in the calibration, and \fIfrequencies\fP is
the number of frequency points.
If not given, \fIfMin\fP and \fIfMax\fP default to 0.05 and 60,
respectively, and \fIfrequencies\fP defaults to 50.
The \fIsetup\fP option is the hardware setup of the VNA, e.g. selecting
between the classic reflection bridge configuration that measures
only S11 and S21, the full S-parameter test set, and the RF IV
module.
In version 0.0.0, this option is ignored and only the classic reflection
bridge setup is supported.
The \fIstandards\fP option is a comma-separated list of calibration names.
Built-in names include the one-port standards S (short), O (open),
and M (match), the two-port standards such as S-O (short-open),
S-M (short-match), O-S (open-short), etc., T (through), and short-hand
names SOLT and TOSL for common sequences of standards.
User-defined standards based on measured values can also be given.
In version 0.0.0, this option is ignored \- only SOLT is available.

l l.
\fB-f\fP|\fB--frequency\fP@test frequency in MHz to generate
.TE
.sp 1
Calibrate the VNA time-base.
The \fIfrequency_MHz\fP argument gives the frequency to generate in MHz.
If not given, \fIfrequency_MHz\fP defaults to 10.
The command then prompts for a measured frequency.
The user next measures the VNA output frequency with a trusted frequency
counter and enters the measured frequency in MHz.
Basaed on the measurement, \fBn2pkvna\fP recomputes the frequency scaling
constant and saves it to the VNA configuration file.
.\"
.IP "\fBgen\fP|\fBgenerate\fP \fIRF-MHz\fP [[\fILO-MHz\fP] [\fIphase-deg\fP]]" 4n
Use the VNA as an RF frequency generator.
The \fIRF-MHz\fP parameter specifies the frequency to generate on the
RF output port in MHz.
The optional \fILO-MHz\fP parameter gives the frequency to generate on
the local oscillator (LO) port; if not given, it defaults to \fIRF-MHz\fP.
The optional \fIphase-deg\fP gives the phase in degrees of the LO
output relative to that of the RF output.
The \fIphase-deg\fP option is most useful when \fILO-MHz\fP is either
equal to or a small rational fraction of \fIRF-MHz\fP.

.TE
.sp 1
Measure a device under test and save the measurements to a file.
The \fIcalibration\fP parameter specifies which calibration name to use.
This parameter is required.
The \fIfMin\fP and \fIfMax\fP parameters are the minimum and maximum
frequencies in MHz used, which must lie within the calibration frequency
range.  The \fIfrequencies\fP parameter is
the number of frequency points in the measurement, and the linear and
log options determine whether linear or logarithmic frequency spacing
is used.
The parameters all default to those given in the calibration if not
specified.
The output \fIfilename\fP is the name of the save file.
If \fIfilename\fP has an extension of \fB.s2p\fP, the parameters are
saved in Touchstone version 1 format; if it has an extension of \fB.ts\fP,
the parameters are saved in Touchstone version 2 format; if it has an
extension of \fB.npd\fP, the parameters are saved in awk and gnuplot
friendly network parameter data format (NPD).
If the extension is not unrecognized, \fBn2pkvna\fP uses NPD format.
If no output file is given, \fBn2pkvna\fP uses a default name based
on the current date and time in Touchstone version 1 format.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-a\fP|\fB--attenuation\fP=\fIattenuation\fP"
Set the attenuation control to \fIattenuation\fP in dB.
Valid values are 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70.
.\"
.IP "\fB-N\fP|\fB--name\fP=\fIname\fP"
Specify the name of the directory containing configuration files for
the \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2 device.
If \fIname\fP contains any slash characters, it's interpreted as a
pathname to the configuration directory.  If \fIname\fP does not contain
slash characters, and if the \s-2HOME\s+2 environment variable is defined,
\fIn2pkvna\fP uses \s-2$HOME\s+2/.n2pkvna/\fIname\fP.
If the name option isn't given and there's only one \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2 device in
the system, the \fBn2pkvna\fP command provides a default; thus this option is
usually needed only when there are multiple \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2fP devices in the
system.
.\"
.IP "\fB-U\fP|\fB--unit\fP=\fIunit\fP"
Specify the hardware unit address of the VNA.  This option selects devices
by USB vendor and product by setting \fIunit\fP to two four-character
long hexadecimal strings separated by a colon, e.g. "0547:100b", or by
USB bus and device by separating them with a dot, e.g. "2.3", or by USB
bus and port by separating them with a slash, e.g. "2/1". The \fIunitf\fP
parameter may also be given as a comma-separated list of these, or parts
thereof, e.g. "0547:,2/1", meaning vendor 0x0547, bus 2, port 1, with
product and device unspecified.  The bus.device form always identifies a
device uniquely, but its value changes whenever the device is disconnected
and reconnected, so it's not durable over reconfigurations.  If the
unit option isn't given and there's only one \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2 device
with a standard vendor and product code, \fBn2pkvna\fP determines the
unit address automatically; thus this option is usually needed only when
there are multiple \s-2N2PK VNA\s+2 devices in the system.  Currently,
\fBn2pkvna\fP supports only USB devcies; however, the \fIunit\fP syntax
may be extended in future versions to support other bus types such as
the parallel port.
