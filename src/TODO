- Break out BUILD instructions into a separate file from README The
  reason is that the README gets installed in /usr/share/doc/n2pkvna/
  and should probably just describe what the program does.

- Create a public RPM repo.

- Create a public Debian repo.  Look at the following link for example:
  https://www.dynamsoft.com/codepool/linux-debian-reporisory-reprepro.html

- Implement setup delete -- like edit, but pop up a confirm dialog.

- Implement cal delete (where should this button go? -- setup?)

- When symmetrical DUT is selected, display only s11 and s21 (or s12)
  curves on the graphs.  See comments in m_load_clicked_cb.

- Implement Smith chart + extended Smith chart for S parameters
  with magnitudes > 1

- Implement polar plots

- Fix the plot functions to better handle > 2 ports.  Either show
  all or show first two.

- Implement the attenuation button on the measure screen and in the
  C code.  Start with the simple approach of just scaling up the raw
  measurements before calibration, using the assumption that there is
  no signal leakage to the detectors inside the VNA, i.e. all flaws are
  external (bridge, cables, etc.) thus will be linear wrt the driving
  signal.  A more accurate approach, however, may be to create separate
  calibrations for each attenuation (or range, anyway).  Need to build
  the attenuator and do some experiments to decide if this is needed.

- Add a refresh-standards button to the calibrate page.  This will
  require changes to the C code to make it rescan.

- Make the y2range boxes insensitive for plots with no second axis.

- Review the help messages.

- Improve error messages.

- Deal with multiple VNA support and ability to close and reopen the VNA.

- Look at gsettings for saving global preferences such as "dark theme".

? Implement drag & drop to reorder calibration steps.

?  In measure screen, ee-organize the plot range controls under the
  plot window.  Move parameters, coordinates, load and save into the
  left-side panel.  Group title with the plot controls.  Align Range x,
  Range y, etc.  boxes with left side of graph?  ??? - not certain this
  is better

? Make comboboxes with fewer than 2 choices insensitive and have them
  default to the single choice.  Make those with 2+ choices sensitive.
